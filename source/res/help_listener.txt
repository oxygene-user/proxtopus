Help about listeners.
The config must contain a block of listeners:

listeners \{
  lstnr1 \{
    ...
  }
  lstnr2 \{
    ...
  }
  lstnr3 \{
    ...
  }
  ...
}

lstnr1, lstnr2, lstnr3 - names of listeners. Listener's name can be anything. This only affects the display in the log.
Each listener contains the following required fields:
  {type} (possible values: "tcp", "udp" or combined value: "tcp|udp" for  {direct} or {shadowsocks} handlers),
  {bind} (bind address and port; typical values: "0.0.0.0:PORT", "127.0.0.1:PORT", "[::]:PORT", "[::1]:PORT" etc...),
Also the listener must contain a required block {handler}.
Thus, the listener only listens to the port. The work with packets arriving on this port is performed directly by the {handler}.
Type {$(EXE) help handler} for more information about handlers.
