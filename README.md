# imconee
Intermediate Connection Engine: socks/shadowsocks proxy client and server

The main principle of writing this project: no third-party libraries! To build the project, you will only need files from this repository.

Supported platforms: windows (can work as service), linux<br>
Supported protocols: socks4/5 and Shadowsocks 2012 (Only AEAD cipher)<br>
For cryptography the [Botan](https://github.com/randombit/botan) library was used. However, in accordance with the main principle, the necessary files from this library were put in this repository.

# config.txt
The config describes three entities: **listeners**, **handlers**, and **proxies**. The relationship between **listeners** and **handlers** is one to one. In fact, you place a **handler** inside a **listener**, thereby assigning a port and protocol (TCP or UDP) to the **handler**. A **proxy** (or upstream proxy) is a descriptor of an external connection point. It is declared once for each unique point and can be used an unlimited number of times in any **handler** as a proxy chain. All outgoing traffic from the **handler** will go through the specified chain. See config.txt example [here](https://github.com/oxygene-user/imconee/blob/main/conf/config.txt).

# build
Source code written in c++20<br>
To build for windows, you have to use MSVC 2022<br>
To build for linux, you have to install at least gcc v10. You can just type make (makefile is in sources) or use Code::Blocks IDE (cbp file also included)

# install (windows)
Put **imconee64.exe** into an dir as you wish. Put **config.txt** (example included) near exe, edit it (documentation comming soon). Just run exe (as ordinary console app). To run as windows service, type **imconee64 install**.

# install (linux)
Put **config.txt** near executable file and run. More detailed instructions will be available soon.
